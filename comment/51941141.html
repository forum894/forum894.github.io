<p>And for the record: I was the one that cleaned up earlier, so please don't blame Marakata for that. Please read your email.</p>
<p>For those whose essays got removed: please do not repost since they will get deleted again. The Duolingo forums are not the place for this and we've warned you more than enough times about this.</p>
<p>Happy learning! Looking forward to posts that do not fall under either spam or minimodding. :)</p><pre><a href="/comment/51941141.html">2021-08-30T11:29:02Z</a></pre><h3>11 bình luận</h3><blockquote><pre>TzcroSSide | Vote: 2</pre><p>The comments on this topic are rubbish(Duolingo in Vietnamese ). They just comment like: "1 vote nha" and something like that. That's spam and I can't  report it because it's too many</p><pre>2021-08-31T06:02:12Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><pre>KevinR86 | Vote: 1</pre><p>Whenever you get the urge to mini-mod please do remember to use the report function. </p>
<p>It is here so you can assist us as we clear guideline breaking content. We want a healthy forum like everyone else does here. :) </p><pre>2021-08-30T15:39:02Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><pre>thichic | Vote: 0</pre><p>WE'RE SORRY</p><pre>2021-08-30T11:34:33Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>thpbi | Vote: 0</pre><p>me too</p>

I am really sorry!</p><pre>2021-08-30T11:37:06Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><pre>scratchandgame_ | Vote: 0</pre><p>Yes, I'm sorry. But one of my post has been deleted and I can't get any reason from Marakata for that, I have checked both my email and the topic's comment (owner can still view the topic comment and topic content, even comment in his/her deleted topic) but didn't get any comment or mail.</p><pre>2021-08-30T12:20:57Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>phoenix7777777 | Vote: 2</pre><p>Perhaps it wasn't Marakata at all but someone else... what was the post about? Another one about bots? I can see that they commented and locked a couple of your posts as well, which means you did get an explanation for those.</p><pre>2021-08-30T12:50:45Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><pre>marakata | Vote: 0</pre><p>Could you please tell me exactly what the title of your post that got deleted from Mods without warnings? When did you post it?</p>
<p>Edit: and when you didn't get any warnings from me, why did you know that your post was deleted by me?</p><pre>2021-08-30T13:13:27Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>scratchandgame_ | Vote: 0</pre><p>My post about the bot. You have said that don't post any other topic about the bots, that you have deleted that topic. So I know about it.</p>
<p>This issue is not closed.</p><pre>2021-10-13T07:06:41Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>marakata | Vote: 0</pre><p>Since I asked you not post any other posts about it, but you kept posting it, you broke the rules and I could delete it without (more) warnings.</p><pre>2021-10-13T14:27:22Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><pre>marakata | Vote: 0</pre><p>And if I remember it correctly, Phoenix also asked you the same, not post any more threads about it, if you post, they would be deleted without warnings.</p><pre>2021-10-13T14:33:33Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><pre>ThanhThao191197 | Vote: 0</pre><p>Hi Everyone.

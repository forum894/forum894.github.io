<hr>
<p>A hunter and his hound, high in the desert mountains, found a cave. The hunter in the cave found a <em>hollow</em>, and the hollow was filled with the most beautiful, clear honey. He took his <em>container</em>, filled it with honey, and left the cave to come down from mountains. He was not in his own land.</p>
<p>And there in the town that he entered, he saw an oil seller. He went into that <em>stall</em> and offered his honey for sale - perhaps an exchange for some oil? And the oil seller was <em>intrigued</em>. As he was tasting the honey, one drop of honey fell upon the ground.</p>
<p>Some flies <em>buzzed</em>, <em>swarming</em> around honey. And as they swarmed there, some birds flew down to <em>peck</em> and eat the insects. But as the birds flew, <em>darting</em> among those insects, the cat that belonged to the oil seller <em>leapt</em> upon a bird and killed it. And as the cat leapt upon the bird, the hound of the hunter leapt forward and killed the cat.</p>
<p>The oil seller, full and fury, kicked the hound so hard that the hound was killed.</p>
<p>The hunter drew his hunting knife and killed the oil seller.</p>
<p>Those who were outside the stall came rushing in. They beat the foreigner to death.</p>
<p>Word reached the people - in the hunter's own land - of his murder. They sent people from his village over the <em>bored</em> and they killed many of the men in that town.</p>
<p>When the King of that land heard about this situation, he gathered a great army and <em>waged war</em> against his neighbour. And the kingdom retaliated.</p>
<p>Wars raged for many years. And wars have raged for many years since that time: two great enemies those neighbouring lands. And all because of one drop of money.</p>

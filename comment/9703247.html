<p>I was a new student in class 7, the number of books that I read not much. almost just as textbooks, reference books, and some literary books, comics. but do not read many books, but I think reading is very beneficial for us. I think first of all it will help you improve your spelling and wording. reading help forge a good habit, parents and guidance I read lots of books to get more knowledge. depending on the conditions when I read books purchased in bookstores, and have time to read books online.
limitations of, in my reading is not available, if so, is that we do not know read the books selected for relevance and a clear origin. avoid reading the book not crimped, depraved distract ability of our study.</p>
<p>I am currently training for his habit of reading every day, I read not much, only three to five pages per day but that was enough for me to know many new knowledge, my limit is, or read on night and consequently I'm nearsighted. hope everyone your skills and reading habits in order to have more knowledge</p>

<p>Firstly, books are the endless sources of <a class="blue-link" href="http://knowledge.In" target="_blank">knowledge.In</a> fact, the knowledge which we study in the school is not enough for us. We should read books to understand the lesson more clearly to do the exercises better. Reading books helps us know many things about our life, understand and explain the interesting natural phenomena, improve our knowledge and help us become the people having broad understanding. That helps to build a better society.
Everybody, not only students,teachers but also doctors, scientists,artists  need to widen their knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, reading books brings us joy and reduces stress. If you feel sad and under stress, you could read books to relax and feel better.Reading books also helps us improve our mood and becomes the positive people.</p>
<p>Although reading books brings us many advantages, reading books has the disadvantages.Unless you find the interesting books which is suitable for you, you will waste a lot of time to read the pointless books which is not helpful for you.Reading books also reduces the <a class="blue-link" href="http://vision.It" target="_blank">vision.It</a> is more boring than watching television or surfing Internet.</p>
<p>In conclusion, reading books brings us many advantages so we could read books regularly.</p><pre>2015-07-24T11:21:17Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>Love-Is-A-Joke | Vote: 0</pre><p>Thank you very much for joining my game!

The book saved the knowledge over thousand years and our mission is acquiring it.</p>

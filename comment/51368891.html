<ul>
<li>
<p>Describe the image below in English. What do you see there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other learners correct your description so that you can learn from it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced learners</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't just describe the picture, but connect it with your associations and memories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other learners not only correct your text, but also give alternatives on how to express it better</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>I would write the first part like this:</p>

<p>The second part, as sad as it makes me feel, is written very well.

<p>ETA (edited to add): if you do, it might be best to do so for those learning <strong>Vietnamese from English</strong>, since you'd be able to correct their Vietnamese and of course post it in the correct forum, not this one.

<p><strong>I think it is a meal at a restaurant, or at a chophouse (chop house). There are soup, fish sauce, vegetables, eggplant fruits, fried tofu, etc. Normally it is a very happiness meal when you eat with your family. When I write, I regret that I have never been able to eat such a delicious meal. Because my young sister and I are not used to eating certain foods in the photo. But the normal meal in my family is very happiness. So I am happy, and nothing could be happier than eating a meal - good or bad - with your family.</strong></p>

For some people, it's a simple, a basic meal, it just has tofu, soup, fried food,.... but for others, it's a special one. Why? From my point of view, the happiest thing is that after a long time of trying and trying, you return to the porch, where your parents and family are. Eat a delicious meal together, tell each other stories of the past, and plan for the future and this meal is an example of reunion which I mentioned above.

<p>There is a difference in expressing whether your grandma moved away (to another town/city) or is no longer present, both of which no doubt aren't easy to deal with.</p><pre>2021-08-08T08:04:28Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>khanhsdann2k8 | Vote: 1</pre><p>thank you</p><pre>2021-08-08T09:36:27Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>phoenix7777777 | Vote: 1</pre><p>You're welcome. I really want to help you with this, so if you could explain what you meant by those parts that aren't clear yet, like 'trying and trying' or why your grandmother is no longer around.. it's ok if you prefer to do so in Vietnamese, since I can either use Google translate or ask Marakata. :) I've started learning Vietnamese with my other account, but still have a lot to cover.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with using 'crutches' (like GT, or explaining things in your native tongue) while still learning. We all do this, that's how we learn. It's not like you wake up one morning and know everything, these things take time, as well as lots of practice.</p>

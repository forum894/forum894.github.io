This is the first time we discuss together. So... I think topic today is:
" Why do you want to learn English? "
For me, It is an interesting subject at school and I like the speaking period best. More, It is an international language, so, with it, I can find a good job in the future. Do you want to travel all over the world? I say: "Yes". If you can speak English well, you can go to most of the countries you like and don't worry...
What about you? Let me know.

1. Flower of Titan Arum (Amorphophallus titanium)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Amorphophallustitanium.jpg"></p>
<p>Not only is one of the largest flowers in the world, Titan Arum flower is also known as the world's rotten flower, also known as "corpse flower" because of its distinctive scent that carries the smell of rotten flesh when the flower blooms.</p>
<p>However, Titan Arum flowers rarely bloom and during the blooming period the unpleasant scent of the flowers can linger in the air for days.</p>
<p>In fact, Titan Arum is not just a single flower, it has thousands of tiny flowers located below the calyx. Therefore, botanists call it an inflorescence. The Titan Arum inflorescence is recognized as the largest inflorescence in the world, with a height of up to 3m.</p>
<p>Originating from the tropical forests of Central Sumatra, western Indonesia, the Titan Arum flower has the scientific name Amorphophallus titanium (giant distorted penis flower). The scent of Titan Arum flowers attracts pollinators such as beetles and flesh flies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Corpse Lily (Rafflesia arnoldii)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Rafflesiaarnoldii.jpg"></p>
<p>Rafflesia arnoldii is one of those flowers that carry the scent of corpses. It is native to the tropical forests of the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Rafflesia is a parasitic flower that sucks up water and nutrients on the stem of the Tetrastigma vine. It has no leaves, stems, roots or chlorophyll. Therefore, it is rare for humans to see corpse lilies in the wild.</p>
<p>When ready to spawn, the flower will produce a mass resembling a blooming cabbage. About a year later, each wing will open but only for a few days. After that, the Rafflesia flower will grow as a round fruit, containing thousands of seeds inside and dispersed by animals throughout the forest.</p>
<ol>
<li>Western skunk cabbage (Lysichiton americanus)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Lysichitonamericanus.jpg"></p>
<p>Although not too bad in appearance, Lysichiton americanus is called skunk cabbage because it is native to the swamps of the Pacific Northwest region, with an aroma that flies and beetles cannot resist. Okay.</p>
<p>Compared to the corpse flower, the skunk cabbage is much smaller in size. In addition, they also have the strange feature that when the flower blooms, the flower stalk often increases heat, helping to melt the snow below to create conditions for pollinating insects to get closer to the flower.</p>
<p>In particular, after the winter break, bears often eat skunk cabbage flowers because they have a laxative effect.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rotten starfish (Stapelia gigantea)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Stapeliagigantea.jpg"></p>
<p>Stapelia gigantea flower is also known as rotten flower, toad flower, giant Zulu flower. They are native to South Africa and are plants grown to kill flies.</p>
<p>The appearance of rotten starfish flowers is quite similar to cactus flowers. Petals bloom into 5 petals like a star. Flowers with pale pink skin are covered with small white hairs that attract flies and maggots to pollinate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Root rot (Hydnora Africana)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/HydnoraAfricana.jpg"></p>
<p>The parasitic plant Hydnora Africana is native to the arid deserts of southern Africa, growing completely underground.</p>
<p>These parasites live off the roots of the Euphorbia plant. Red and pale pink flowers emerge from the sand. Black beetles are always attracted by the characteristic stench of this flower.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rotten horse flower (Helicodiceros muscivorus)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Helicodicerosmuscivorus.jpg"></p>
<p>Native to the northwest Mediterranean region, the rare rotten horseflower with striped petals resembles that of a horse but carries the stench of rotting flesh, producing heat that helps lure flies in in the flower.</p>
<p>On a warm sunny day, the female flowers will open and release the odor. The flies will quickly be attracted, drawn deep inside and then stuck in it for a whole day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Oriental stink cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus)</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="https://e.khoahoc.tv/photos/image/062012/19/Symplocarpusfoetidus.jpg"></p>
<p>Like the Western skunk cabbage, the Eastern skunk cabbage has a habit of living and growing in swampy areas.</p>
<p>In spring, oriental cabbage flowers often bloom and these flowers are up to 10cm long, 15cm high, the stem part turns dark purple. After the flowers bloom, a few green flower leaves will appear on the ground. These flower leaves will release a characteristic stench.</p>

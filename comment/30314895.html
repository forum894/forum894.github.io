<p>=&gt; Vì thế mình rất thắc mắc là có nên đổi <strong>"yourself" =&gt; thành "countryside / motherland"</strong> ko hở bạn?? Chứ nếu ko sẽ bị gọi là <strong>lạc đề</strong> á bạn ơi vì chủ đề đâu có liên quan đến phần gợi ý của bạn đâu?!? Mong bạn xem xét, cảm ơn nhiều ạ~</p>

<li>Ừm về việc đó thì theo tớ ''Introduce yourself'' có nghĩ là giới thiệu về bản thân trong đó cũng sẽ có giới thiệu về nơi mình đang sống. Lí do: nếu giới thiệu về ''countryside'' thì có hơi thu gọn, ý tớ là tớ muốn mở rộng ý ra một chút.</li>

<p>My family have four people such as mom, dad, sister and me. At present, customs and tradition are very important in the life of each person. Like other family, my family also have our own traditions and customs. There is a tradition in our family of seeing the fireworks in on New Year's Eve. Everyone in my family went to the square and watched the fireworks in the night sky. We did that together for every year. In the modern life, there are so many people moving to live in city. Because the city have a lot of people so they can develop the economy for the family. At present, few people live in the countryside. However, I still like living in the countryside. We can run around the vast field, swimming in the rivers, collec many vegetables in the afternoon or in the summer. Morever, we can enjoy the fresh air and peaceful space. The people in the countryside are very kind, generous and friendly. Because they can live a happy life at here. I really enjoy living here, but maybe my future is going to live in the city but I never forget about the time when I lived here. Because this place is so familiar and close to my life.</p>

<p>My neighbourhood is in the countryside. There are three schools, a post office and some shops in my neighbourhood but there isn't a park  and a cinema. The streets are narrow but they are clean. The air is fresh too. You can see many trees around here. The people here is friendly, hard-working and smart. And every house has a front yard and a back yard. I like living in my neighbourhood because it is peaceful. In the future, I will make my neighbourhood more beautiful and more modern. I love my neighbourhood very much.</p><pre>2019-01-10T09:23:59Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>...Oinyn... | Vote: 0</pre><ul>

<p><strong>"Motherland" is the trade body calls for two hours for every one man.That's where we saw by born, grow up and mature.For me, home is beautiful and each time prompted calls home seen in how hard feelings rise movement.Home is a village very abundant.The straight wings, storks, the Princess Bride, green corn this afternoon I horizon to Titus.Village roads zigzag winding, but extremely clean because made of concrete.From there the road clean concrete, we go to school no longer muddy to mud as before.The two-storey house grows up thanks to increasingly innovative.Now in his hometown of children no longer have any more cottages which all have tile House . So October last year, I've received the title of the new country.But that life had more prosper but in the countryside, people still live together in harmony, so emotional.When beginning a new day, the farmers usually brunch place.The crop push Bazaar, talking about the price today.Also we shall call each other in school, with little jokes and talking makes small neighbor villages become tumultuous and full of life.The evening cultural festival, the tool man she also excited to go see and read poetry, storytelling. The kite enough color, shapes up high, forever on the slopes of the windswept dike is probably the photo that I enjoy the most.Hope the dreams of us later will also fly high, fly away like that.Are you hometown appearance change each day and on a richer and more beautiful.I loved his hometown.Thus, after this, despite going away, I will always remember about the homeland.</strong></p>

<h5>My family has four people, they are my dad, my mom, my younger brother and me. My family lives in the countryside, our lives here are so peaceful. Life silently passes without many problems. Every member in my family has a routine with the life here, they are all frugal with everything. Especially, people here are very sociable. Whenever someone needs any helps, they even help enthusiastically without scrupling. Every night, I always fly kites, catch fireflies with my village friends. It's very fun. You know, many people left countryside to move to city because it's difficult to have a job here and it's synonymous with difficulty in earning much money. Their lives here are very hard. Nevertheless, I still love living here, it make me feel comfortable when i think of my life. Everything here is very familiar to me. Villagers, nature, atmosphere, animals,...They're the best things to me. Although life in cities is modern, happy, I don't think that I can live happily if I lack my best things. In the future, when I grow up, I will never forget my homeland. It will always inculcate in my mind forever....</h5>

<p>I live in the suburbs of Thanh Hoa city. My neighbourhood is very beautiful. Here, the weather is wonderful and the streets aren't crowed so it will be great if I want to go out to ride bike, walk,... There are many shops and small restaurants. They make I feel convenient when I go out.  In my neighbourhood, the houses are low but they are large. The houses are surrounded by the fields where people grow rice and vegetables. The food there is very delicous, if you eat them, I sure you won't forget them. At many festivals, my neighbourhood often organizes some traditional games as: tug of war, bamboo dancing,... Special, people in my neighbourhood are all friendly. They like helping each other when that person has problems. </p>
<p>There is one thing I dislike about it: my neighbourhood is less convenient than most places. I hope it will be more and more convenient. But however, I always love my neighbourhood.</p><pre>2019-01-10T13:56:13Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>...Oinyn... | Vote: 0</pre><ul>

"Hometown" are two divine call. It is where we were born, grow up and mature. People who live far away from home always remember their homeland. 
My hometown is a countryside associated with cultivation. The air here is so fresh. The sky is blue and vast. Golden rice fields hatched and roared with laughter in the harvest days. The gentle winds breeze makes us feel extremely comfortable and like sinking into the magical space of paradise. The weather is good. People here are gentle, hardworking and hospitable. They always help neighbors when they encounter difficulties. The houses in my hometown are beautiful. People grow many tall and big trees. In my hometown, there are many traditional dishes. They are so delicious and fragrant.
However, there is a problem I dislike. Nowaday, there are many motorbikes and cars, so the streets are crowded polluted during the day. I hope it will be cleaner and fresher in the future.

<p><strong>My family has four people: my mother, my father, my little brother and me. I am like a normal person in the world. I have mom, dad, siblings and especially, I have my own hometown. It is Xuan Son Nam-a small village in Dong Xuan. It has the own beauty such as: paddy-fields, rivers, lakes, and so on. When I was a little child, I usually ran along the rivers and smelled the fragrant of rice, i had a lot of memories about it. My hometown is far from the place that I live, it is about 45 kilometres long so i cannot visit my hometown usually. The people here are friendly, helpful and sociable. We always live in peace. When i return to my hometown, we always gather together and have a delicious meal.  At New Year's Eva, we often watch the firework on TV. I think this is the most interesting thing i have try. I love my hometown and my family so much.</strong></p>

<h5>I am currently living in Ho Chi Minh City or it is also known as Saigon with my family. I really love my country, because it’s a peaceful country and has many beautiful places. If you have any occasion to visit here, you will never forget. Saigon is a very crowded city, and it is seemed that it never sleeps. Since this is a gathering place for many people with different culture throughout the country, the life-style here is always filled with interesting and new things. It is a harmonious combination of modern and classic things. We can easily find the ancient buildings in the middle of the city or right behind the high buildings are several small alleys with the values ​​that have existed for so long. People here work very hard, but they also enjoy life a lot. Saigon people – or we usually call them Saigonners love to explore food, take pictures, and gather with friends at coffee shops. The food here is very abundant, from the regional dishes to the famous international dishes. Tourists love to explore street food here, and Saigon has a lot of features that we should not miss. This city is considered as the heart of the South, and we can find almost everything here. Saigon is a warm place, and it will treat those who really want to find opportunities here well.</h5>
<h5>Saigon is the largest city in Vietnam with an extremely huge amount of residents, so almost every street and corner in the center of the city is always bustling. Saigon is famous for its skyscrapers and crowded malls. People love to do shopping, so every weekend the shopping malls are always full of shoppers. The life-style here is very fast and hurried, but people try to spend their free time in the evenings hanging around the streets. Saigon at night is very beautiful, people love to gather in the coffee shops or sit in river banks that go along the streets. My friends and I usually hang out in the evening, and we would like to find as many different places to eat as possible. Along with the beauty, Saigon is also famous for delicious fool, and it is felt like that the street food is usually better than one in big restaurants. There are so many things left to say about this lovely city, and we can only see the rest of it by exploring it ourselves. I love my hometown and my family so much.</h5>

Where I was born was a very peaceful countryside. The muddy and winding roads make it hard for people to overcome, that is, before the road is covered with cement, people's travel is now easier. Early in the morning, neighbors prepare fresh vegetables for sale at the market. When the sun rises, on the dreamy fields are farmers who are busy working to prepare for the next crop. Next to the small river, there is a stone bridge crossing, every day students go to school by this road, on both sides of the river are shady trees. There are also high mountains, on the top of the mountain often visited by white clouds. When foreigners visit this countryside, people here are warmly welcomed. In the afternoon, around the river bank, there are children who often come here to play. When the sun was about to set, we watched the sunset together, among the sunsets I watched, probably the most beautiful here. When I recall those times, I promised my heart that I will definitely not forget where I was born!                                                                                 </p><pre>2019-01-11T13:09:20Z</pre><p><br></p><blockquote><pre>...Oinyn... | Vote: 0</pre><ul>

<p><strong>In each person, everyone has a homeland, a place where the umbilical cord is cut. Me too, I love my hometown, my source with all my heart. My hometown is Hanoi capital.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When it comes to Hanoi, many people will talk about capital at bustling pace. But for me, Hanoi has a calm and own beauty that is nowhere to be found. On autumn days, the fragrant and fragrant flowers smelled of milk flowers from the street corners, I often ran to the alley to enjoy this scent. I love both Hanoi people, they are polite, elegant in their eating, speaking and behavior. They are humorous and sociable, in essence, the Hanoi people still have patriotism and love the capital</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hanoi is famous for its historical relics such as the Ly Dynasty One Pillar Pagoda with the image of "lotus" "national flower of the nation. Or Van Mieu Quoc Tu Giam, Ho Guom with the legend of "paying the sword" of Le Loi, ... many other historical relics show that Hanoi still retains the soul and definition of the Vietnamese people.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Night. Hanoi, it's a bit chilly, light up is a street lamp, a light, bringing the colors of the night, of Hanoi night. After a day of working with worries and fatigue, the night came to be a relaxing and comfortable place for me to be with my family and relatives. It's just a walk together, walking together to admire the Sword Lake at night, but it's all a habit, a lifestyle of Hanoi people and mine. Laughter said, car, radio on both sides of the road made Hanoi like youthful, full of vitality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In my eyes, Hanoi is like the first love of childhood. I love Hanoi not only because it is famous, beautiful, modern. Simply because I loved Hanoi right from my childhood. So, "Hanoi is always in my heart ♥️"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong></p>

It is a harmonious combination of modern and classic things. There are usually many visitors here. Therefore, Ho Chi Minh City is one of the famous tourist destinations of Vietnam and internationally. There are many famous landmarks here: Notre Dame Cathedral, Ben Thanh Market, Nha Rong Habour, Reunification Palace, etc. Saigon is famous for its skyscrapers and crowded malls: Bitexco financial tower, Vincom, etc.  People here very friendly. They work very hard, but they also enjoy life a lot. Saigon people – or we usually call them Saigonners love to explore food, take pictures, and gather with friends at coffee shops.

<p><strong><em><font color="olive">My full name is ĐHN. I am quite old (laugh) so I will not tell my real age in this paragraph. I live in TCN village, CT district and TG province – it is a lovely place with peaceful atmosphere where lots of foreigners visit it sometimes. My family has 4 members include my dad – a doctor, mom – a pharmacist, my elder sister – just received MA degree of Germany last month and me.</font></em></strong> </p>
<p><strong><font color="teal">Personally, I am not a beautiful girl or an ugly girl. I am normal, humorous, friendly and rather smart. My zodiac is Aries so my character is hardly telling lies. My zodiac also shows that I will be leading a company in the future. Especially, as being Aries, I have an interest in watching politics and sometimes dream about attending to a conference and become a Political leader. But everytime I dream about that, my mom always rejects my "tiny" dream. And yes, after that time, I have never dreamed about that again. As I belong to Aries, in my free time, even the weather is good or bad, I always love watching the various movements of clouds (my personality is so weird right?).</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><font color="cornflowerblue">Moreover, I sometimes wonder that if I would be able to find a new kind of coal or not in the prospective life. And that's one of my favourite things to reflect upon if I could receive a proposal from the government to discover once in my life. In general, it would be awesome if I had a chance to perform and try once. Therefore, I love myself very much and I always try to study hard to make my family happy and please them.</font></em></strong></p>

At present, customs and tradition are very important in the life of each person. Like other family, my family also have our own traditions and customs. There is a tradition in our family of seeing the fireworks in on New Year's Eve. Everyone in my family went to the square and watched the fireworks in the night sky. We did that together for every year. In the modern life, there are so many people moving to live in city. Because the city have a lot of people so they can develop the economy for the family. At present, few people live in the countryside. However, I still like living in the countryside. We can run around the vast field, swimming in the rivers, collec many vegetables in the afternoon or in the summer. Morever, we can enjoy the fresh air and peaceful space. The people in the countryside are very kind, generous and friendly. Because they can live a happy life at here. I really enjoy living here, but maybe my future is going to live in the city but I never forget about the time when I lived here. Because this place is so familiar and close to my life.</p><pre>2019-03-23T14:37:02Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><hr>

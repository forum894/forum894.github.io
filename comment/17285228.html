<p>Once a rich merchant was walking along the road with his servant. Out of the blue, a labourer carrying a heavy sack, passed by him. The merchant was hit by the sack and his hat fell in a nearby drain.</p>
<p>The servant thought that the labourer would now get a good scolding, but to his amusement, the merchant instead of scolding the labourer asked the servant to help the labourer pick his sack. </p>
<p>The servant thought that the labourer would now get a good scolding, but to his amusement, the merchant instead of scolding the labourer asked the servant to help the labourer pick his sack. </p>
<p>When the labourer went ahead, the servant asked the merchant for such behaviour. </p>
<p>The merchant said, "It was my mistake, not his. He was already carrying a heavy load. I should have walked carefully."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the servant praised his master.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that a person should never blame others for his fault.</p>
<p>FIGHT ALWAYS GIVES BAD RESULT</p>
<p>One day, two friends while walking along the road saw a nice rope lying by its side. Both wanted to have it and started fighting for it.</p>
<p>One held it from one end and the other from the other end. They started pulling the rope. Suddenly, the rope broke off from the middle. One of them fell in mud and the other in a drain. </p>
<p>A passer by who was watching all this, went to them and said, "Fighting for a thing always gives bad results." The friends felt ashamed of their deed.</p><pre><a href="/comment/17285228.html">2016-08-21T03:33:54Z</a></pre><h3>1 bình luận</h3><blockquote><pre>tungan2005 | Vote: 0</pre><p>hay</p><pre>2016-08-21T04:04:55Z</pre><p><br></p></blockquote><hr>

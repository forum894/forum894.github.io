<li>Get active each day
•   Regular physical activity is important for the healthy growth, development and well-being of children and young people.
•   They should get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day, including vigorous activities that make them ‘huff and puff’.
•   Parents should be good role models and have a positive attitude to being active.</li>
<li>Choose water as a drink
•   Water is the best way to quench your thirst – and it doesn’t come with the added sugar found in fruit juices, soft drinks and other sweetened drinks.
•   Reduced fat milk for children over two is a nutritious drink and a great source of calcium.
•   Give kids whole fruit to eat, rather than offering fruit juices that have a lot of sugar.</li>
<li>Eat more fruit and vegetables
•   Eating fruit and vegetables every day helps children grow and develop, boosts their vitality and can reduce the risk of many chronic diseases.
•   Aim to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables every day.
•   Have fresh fruit available as a convenient snack and try to include fruit and vegies in every meal.</li>
<li>Switch off the screen and get active
•   Sedentary or ‘still’ time spent watching TV, surfing online or playing computer games is linked to kids becoming overweight or obese.
•   Children and young people should spend no more than two hours a day on ‘small screen’ entertainment.
•   Plan a range of active indoor and outdoor games or activities for your children, as alternatives to watching TV or playing on the computer.</li>
<li>Eat fewer snacks and select healthier alternatives
•   Healthy snacks help children and young people meet their daily nutritional needs.
•   Snacks based on fruit and vegetables, reduced fat dairy products and whole grains are the healthiest choices.
•   Avoid snacks that are high in sugar or saturated fats – such as chips, cakes and chocolate – which can cause children to put on excess weight.</li>

<p>Thanks for five years of enjoyable distraction. A lot of effort has gone into most of the language courses. Easy to overlook when absorbed in the difficulties of the exercises. The linked discussions, not only useful for learning a language but also a reminder that its not just you and a tablet computer game, there are many others out there.</p>
<p>Since the early days, I accepted that I was just playing word games. This was fun. Before, I used to play card games and do Sudoku. I didn't need to find time for Duo or give anything else up. Just click on Duo and use memory and a bit of sense to play with Duo instead.</p>
<p>I believe I have been learning, though my scores reflect time spent rather than ability. English remains my only language.</p>
<p>The 'heart system' of the new update has completely destroyed my enthusiasm for Duo. I only ever used the website occasionally. The App was far more practical. Except, the font size for Japanese/Chinese/Arabic, scripts with tiny diacritics etc. and having to resequence words from the 'word bank' or worse retype a whole sentence because of one mistake.</p>
<p>As a marathon runner I'm accustomed to the long slog, difficult terrain and weather, but I have never been disqualified or made to feel unwelcome because I'm slow.</p>
<p>I've used Duo for free (could not afford otherwise), looked at a few advert and perhaps contributed to some statistics. Value for money!</p>
<p>Thanks to Duo, thanks to my friends/followers. And now, goodbye.</p>

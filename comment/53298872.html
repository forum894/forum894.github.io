I have a dream to be a fashion designer.I am often told that I am good at writing and have the qualities to be a writer.I think so too.I told my mother that let me go to teachers who are good at literature and have good works to improve my <a class="blue-link" href="http://skills.My" target="_blank">skills.My</a> mother agreed right away.I worked hard to learn.But ,every time I study like this, I feel very tired and depressed every time I study literature.I only find joy in every time I draw pictures of the fashions that I <a class="blue-link" href="http://love.It" target="_blank">love.It</a> helps me relax, and at the same time it helps me not to be constrained like studying literature, but can do as I like.Right after that, I thought again.I love painting more, why do I have to stick my head in and study literature that I don't love?Since then, I have trained my drawing ability. Studying literature, I still maintain regularly, and also regularly learn to draw.
Gradually, my drawing ability also improved. I took many drawing exams at school and always got good results.
To this day, I still feel very lucky to have finally found my true abilities and dreams.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
